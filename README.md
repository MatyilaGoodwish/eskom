Environmental implications of using or saving one kilowatt-hour of electricity

-Table headings: If electricity consumption is measured in those units Use of table: multiply electricity consumption or saving by the relevant factor to determine the environmental implication.

Example 1: Used 90 kWh of electricity. Water consumption: 90 x 1,40 = 126. Therefore 126 litres of water used.

Example 2: Used 90 GWh of electricity. CO2 emissions 90 x 0,978 = 88,02. Therefore 88,02 thousand tons emitted.
